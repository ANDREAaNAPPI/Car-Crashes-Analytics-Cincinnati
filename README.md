# Car Crashes Analytics Cincinnati
I performed an in depth analysis of Cincinnati car crashes (2010-2021)  market on a publicly available dataset. I performed the analysis as if it had been commissioned by the chief of transportation in Cincinnati, working on both the code and the technical report.
Here you can find:
- [My Python Code](https://github.com/ANDREAaNAPPI/Car-Crashes-Analytics-Cincinnati/blob/main/Cincinnati_car_crashes.ipynb)
  This is the whole data pipeline (almost whole; some procedures were not even worth including to keep the elaborate clean)
- [My PDF Report](https://github.com/ANDREAaNAPPI/Car-Crashes-Analytics-Cincinnati/blob/main/Car%20crashes%20Cincinnati%20Report.pdf)
  The report was performed as if it had been the final product for the transoprtation department of Cincinnati, so I tried to present the insights and explain them in a non-technical language, including only meaningful insights, and 
  without mentioning unnecessary technical details.

  The data comes from data.cincinnati-oh.gov, and you can also find the data on kaggke, [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steverusso/cincinnati-car-crash-data)
